= Configuring the Helm Client

The global flags for Helm can be configured directly in the `helm` DSL block.

Most of these correspond to options that are passed to every Helm CLI command as a parameter
or an environment variable.

[TIP]
====
As these settings can be dependent on the build environment, it is often useful to specify them in
`gradle.properties` or on the command line instead.
See <<Configuration from Project Properties>>.

== Global Helm Options

The following properties can be set on the `helm` extension in the Gradle build script.

|===
| Property | Description | `helm` CLI option

| `executable`
| Path to the `helm` executable. The `PATH` environment variable is taken into account, so this can just be `helm`
 (which is the default) if the Helm client is installed in a suitable location.
|

| `extraArgs`
| Additional arguments to pass to _every_ invocation of `helm`. This can be used for command-line options that have
 no counterpart in the plugin.
|

| `kubeConfig`
| Path to the Kubernetes configuration file.
| Environment variable `KUBECONFIG`

| `kubeContext`
| Name of the kubeconfig context to use.
| `--kube-context`

| `namespace`
| Kubernetes namespace scope.
| `--namespace`

| `remoteTimeout`
| Time to wait for any individual Kubernetes operation (like Jobs for hooks).
| `--timeout` (on certain commands like `install`, `upgrade` or `uninstall`)
|===


== Helm Directories

Starting with Helm 3, Helm does not have a "helm home" directory anymore, and dropped the need for a call to
`helm init` before working with Helm. Instead, local Helm directories are governed by 3 environment variables,
which can be configured in the Gradle `helm` extension. By default, these directories are set to paths inside
the Gradle project, so that any `helm` invocation from the Gradle build is independent from the Helm configuration
present on the local machine.

It is also possible to set these properties via `gradle.properties` or pass them using the `-P` flag on the
Gradle command line (see <<Configuration from Project Properties>>).

See link:https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm/[the Helm docs] for details about how XDG base directories are used
by the Helm CLI.

|===
| `helm` extension property | Description | Environment variable | Default Value

| `xdgDataHome`
| Base directory for storing data. (Note: this does not currently seem to be used by any `helm` command.)
| `XDG_DATA_HOME`
| `build/helm/data` under the project dir

| `xdgConfigHome`
| Base directory for storing configuration.
| `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`
| `build/helm/config` under the project dir

| `xdgCacheHome`
| Base directory for storing cached data.
| `XDG_CACHE_HOME`
| `.gradle/helm/cache` under the _root_ project dir
|===

[NOTE]
====
The cache home, as indicated by `xdgCacheHome`, defaults to a directory under the _root_ project, meaning that
in a multi-module build, all Helm projects will share the same cache by default. This speeds up builds, but may lead
to problems in certain situations, for example if two projects register a different chart repository under the same
name.
+
If necessary, you can always set the cache home to a project-local directory, for example:

[source,groovy,role="primary"]
.Groovy
----
helm {
    xdgCacheHome = file("${project.buildDir}/helm/cache")
}
----

[source,kotlin,role="secondary"]
.Kotlin
----
helm {
    xdgCacheHome.set(file("${project.buildDir}/helm/cache"))
}
----

== Automatic Download of the Helm Client

As an alternative to using a locally installed Helm client, the plugin can automatically download a Helm client
distribution from the official Helm website. This allows build scripts to be more independent from the environment
found on the local machine where the Gradle build runs.

The download can be configured either through the `helm.downloadClient` DSL block or through project properties (e.g.
in the `gradle.properties` file). Project properties have the advantage of being automatically inherited by subprojects,
and are easier to adapt for the local machine.

The following properties control the download of the Helm client:

|===
| DSL property under `helm.downloadClient` | Project property | Description | Default Value

| `enabled`
| `helm.client.download.enabled`
| If set to `true`, the Helm client is downloaded from the remote location.
| `false`

| `version`
| `helm.client.download.version`
| The version of the Helm client to be downloaded.
| The latest version of Helm available at the time the plugin is published (currently `3.2.0`)

| `destinationDir`
|
| The base directory where Helm client executables are extracted. By default, this is a directory under
 `(rootDir)/.gradle`, so the client will only be downloaded and extracted once in a multi-module build, and is not
 removed by a `clean` task. You can set this to a different directory (e.g. under the `build` directory) if you
 prefer different behavior.
| `.gradle/helm/client` under the _root_ project dir

|
| `helm.client.download.baseUrl`
| The base URL for downloading the client executables.

  You can change this to a different URL if required, for example when behind a corporate proxy.
| `https://get.helm.sh/`

|
| `helm.client.download.group`
| A pseudo "group" coordinate for the Helm client artifacts; required for Gradle artifact resolution.

  Change this to a different value in the unlikely case that the default group name `sh.helm` conflicts
  with other external dependencies used by the build script.
| `sh.helm`

|
| `helm.client.download.osClassifier`
| Override the OS classifier (the suffix of the downloaded filename) if auto-detection does not work as expected.
| Auto-detected for the current system based on Java system properties.

  For example, `darwin-amd64` or `windows-amd64`.
